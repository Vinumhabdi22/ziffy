Deployment Guide

 Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

If you haven't already, make sure your code is in a GitHub repository.

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub. copy the repository url.
2.  open vs code and open your project.
3.  open terminal in vs code. and follow the steps below:
4.  git init
5.  git add .
6.  git commit -m "Initial commit"
7.  git branch -M main
8.  git remote add origin <repository url>
9.  git push -u origin main

 Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1.  Go to Vercel.com and sign up (using your GitHub account is easiest).
2.  On your dashboard, click "Add New..." -> "Project".
3.  Import your GitHub repository.
4.  Vercel will detect that it is a Next.js project.
5.  Environment Variables: copy them from `.env` file and paste them into the "Environment Variables" section in Vercel.
6.  Click "Deploy".
7.  Wait a minute for the build to finish. Your site is now live on a `.vercel.app` subdomain!

 Step 4: Configure Custom Domain

If you want to use your own domain (e.g., `www.yourbusiness.com`) instead of the default `vercel.app` link:

1.  Go to your Project Dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
3.  Select "Domains" from the left sidebar.
4.  Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`) and click "Add".

 Updates

Whenever you want to update your website, just push your changes to GitHub. Vercel will automatically detect the new commit and re-deploy your site.

 Deploying to Shared Hosting (cPanel, HostGator, Bluehost etc.)

If you prefer to use standard shared hosting instead of Vercel:

1.  Configure for Static Export (Done):
    Your `next.config.ts` is already configured with `output: "export"`.

2.  Build the Project:
    Run the following command in your terminal:

    npm run build
    
    This will create an `out` folder in your project directory.

3.  Upload to Hosting:
    - Log in to your hosting Control Panel (e.g., cPanel).
    - Go to File Manager.
    - Navigate to your `public_html` folder (or the specific folder for your domain).
    - Upload all the *contents* of the `out` folder (index.html, 404.html, _next folder, etc.) to this directory.

4.  Done!
    Your site should now be live on your domain.
